## Timeline (UTC)

| UTC | Event | Ref | Detail | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-31T17:36:19Z | commit | `56f30ea` | Contract and labeling rule, written before code | git log | I committed CONTRACT.md at 0 bytes; ls -la showed it, and I filled it in the next commit. |
| 2026-10-31T17:37:25Z | commit | `1ce1af0` | Fill in CONTRACT.md before any code | git log |  |
| 2026-10-31T18:18:38Z | commit | `94f5ede` | Resolve contract placeholders: fields, rule keywords, wrong version 3, failure sentence | git log | Claude Code refused to build until I filled the contract placeholders and asked me which persona fields to use; I chose personal.location and skills. |
| 2026-10-31T18:21:34Z | commit | `d138c84` | Watch: allow-listed fetch, state by id, seeded two-run evidence | git log |  |
| 2026-10-31T18:25:54Z | commit | `9c8c20a` | Fill board token and persona city in contract | git log | My grep for "<" missed the HERE placeholders, so the board token and city were filled after the first code commit; no rule changed. |
| 2026-10-31T18:32:56Z | commit | `0bb2599` | Test for wrong version 1: misaligned labels | git log | I checked the tests by name and thought wrong version 1 had none; it did, so this added a second test for it. |
| 2026-10-31T18:35:54Z | commit | `c1506ed` | README: drop stale open-contract-items section | git log |  |
| 2026-10-31T18:39:48Z..19:52:16Z | validator rejections | `evidence/claude_calls.jsonl` | 0 of 70 Claude judge calls rejected by `agent/validator.py`; 0 retries; 0 INVALID | evidence/claude_calls.jsonl |  |
| 2026-10-31T18:40:37Z | commit | `bbd5e0b` | Two judges: rule RECORD and Claude JUDGMENT with validator | git log |  |
| 2026-10-31T18:40:37Z..18:45:52Z | test failure | between `bbd5e0b` and `7cc4199` | 1 failed, 79 passed: `test_system_prompt_loaded_from_file_verbatim` (StopIteration: test fake had 1 response for 2 calls) | pytest output in Claude Code session (not saved to a file) |  |
| 2026-10-31T18:45:52Z | commit | `7cc4199` | Move system prompt into prompts/ for versioning | git log | Claude Code had put a system prompt in code; I made it move into prompts/ so the prompts I submit are the prompts I ran. |
| 2026-10-31T18:58:02Z | commit | `f097cf0` | Labeling sheet, labels blank, stratified selection | git log |  |
| 2026-10-31T19:11:03Z | commit | `c3732b9` | Hand labels by Meena per LABELING.md | git log | All 20 of my labels came out not_relevant because the cloudflare board has nothing for a Boston early-career persona, so the experiment cannot separate v1, v2 and a constant judge. |
| 2026-10-31T19:15:52Z | commit | `f4fec9d` | Sampling report and v1 baseline on dev | git log |  |
| 2026-10-31T19:25:11Z | commit | `8cbaad6` | Fix judge_v2 prompt and rationale before any held-out run | git log |  |
